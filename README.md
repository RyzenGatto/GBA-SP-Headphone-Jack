# GBA-SP-Headphone-Jack
A PCB that enables adding a headphone jack to a GBA SP. Complete PCB's will be available for sale soon.

This PCB was inspired by Hidarite on Tindy, however, the PCB was designed fully by myself without any files or IP from Hidarite. This was made due to the fact that Hidarite stopped selling this item.

This PCB is free for anyone to make and use for themselves, but no one may sell the PCB or otherwise use it for financial gain without express and writen permission from myself. For more details, please view the licance.

NOTE: THIS IS STILL IN THE PROTOTYPING PHASE
