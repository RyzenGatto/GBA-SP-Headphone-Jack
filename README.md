# GBA-SP-Headphone-Jack
A PCB that enables adding a headphone jack to a GBA SP. Complete PCB's will be available for sale soon.

This PCB was inspired by Hidarite on Tindy, however, the PCB was designed fully by myself without any files or IP from Hidarite. This was made due to the fact that Hidarite stopped selling this item.

This PCB is free for anyone to make and use for themselves, but no one may sell the PCB or otherwise use it for financial gain without express and writen permission from myself. For more details, please view the licance.

NOTE: THIS IS STILL IN THE PROTOTYPING PHASE

# Version 1.2

I recieved the revision 1.02 parts and have made some modifications. The board was too long so it was shrunk. The text was also unreadable so it was enlargened and repositioned. I also noticed that the solder pads were not all the correct size, they are now. The PCB was also too thick so I ordered a 0.8mm thickness one (half the thickness of 1.02). 

Also, the reason for skipping version 1.1 was because 1.1 went to a different concept. It will be posted soon.
